# resume
My resume, based on [Junhao Dong's Resume](https://github.com/junhaodong/resume), which was largely sourced and inspired from [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV).

View the [PDF](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yeyande/resume/master/resume.pdf).

## Quick Start
Feel free to modify my `.tex` file to create your own resume! Please don't use my resume for anything else without permission though.
